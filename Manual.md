# Manual

Quick start manual for the application.

## Development Pipeline

The development pipeline will run tests and start the `DEBUG` build of the application.

### Starting up

Run:

```
docker-compose up --build
```

You can remove `--build` on subsequent runs.

Then open a web browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:4005/
```

You can change the port number from [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/jackula83/cs.code-challenge/blob/main/docker-compose.yml)
