# cs.code-challenge

## Description

An application that assigns sales people to customers, based on spoken language and the specialty area.

## Challenges

- Provided data `salesperson.json` collates language and specialty information together.
- Rule-set [here](https://github.com/farajfarook/code-challenge) is inconsistent, particularly the `Tradie Vehicle` specialty.
- Requirement for `No-storing data` puts emphasis of data modelling and management in the application layer.
- Allowed time for coding is 2 days at best in between work, parenting and chores. However can still rough out the design in my head at other times.
- Preference for AngularJS for the frontend, instead I will be using React. I can learn Angular but I can't do it within 2 days **and** finish the code.
